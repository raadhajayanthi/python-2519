#comments - Identiers - means just a word without allocating any value 
#example - sum,total etc..,
#When you assign a value, that identifier becomes a variable

a = 10
b = 20
print(a+b)

#print(helloworld) - syntax error we didnt declare 

print(9)
print(8.9)

a = 10
print(a)

greetings = "good morning"
print(greetings)


#declare in single/double quotes
print("hello") 
print('hello')


#there are some keywords we cant use that keywords as names 

#we should not use name starts with digits 
data = "hello"
# 2daydata = "hello" -> invalid, as it starts with digit
_2daydata = "hello"


#class = 'a' error becaues class is keyword


# Bad way of using identifiers
x = "Ravi"
y = 25
z = "Python Course"

# Good way of using identifiers
